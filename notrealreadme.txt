# Seizure Seeker ⚡

Seizure Seeker is a browser-based application that detects seizure-like events in EEG data provided as `.edf` or `.csv` files. The detection process runs entirely on the client side, ensuring that no data is transmitted externally.

---

## 📌 Features

- Local-only RMS-based seizure detector (no server, no dependencies)
- Accepts EDF, EDF+ and numeric CSV files
- Adjustable threshold, minimum duration, and sampling rate (for CSV)
- Results rendered in a dynamic HTML table
- No installation required – runs in Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- Fully responsive, dark-themed UI with accent colors

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/your-org/seizure-seeker.git
$ cd seizure-seeker

# Open the tool
$ open seizure_detector.html  # or double-click to open in your browser
```

Once opened:
1. Click **Choose file** and select an `.edf` or `.csv` file
2. Set the z-score threshold and minimum duration if needed
3. Click **Analyze** to see detected seizure segments

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Signal is windowed into 1-second RMS frames with 50% overlap
2. A baseline is computed using `median + MAD` from the first 5 minutes or 10% of the file
3. Frames exceeding `baseline + (z × MAD)` are flagged
4. Neighboring flagged regions within 5 seconds are merged
5. Segments shorter than the minimum duration (default 15 seconds) are discarded

---

## 📂 File Format Guidelines

### EDF
- Regular EDF or EDF+ (16-bit little-endian)
- Only the first channel is used (by default)

### CSV
- Header row must be present
- Only numeric columns are considered
- Sampling rate must be set manually in the UI

---

## ⚙️ Customization

Modify `seizure_detector.html` directly. Example:

```js
// Change merge gap or use multi-channel logic
const mergeGap = 5; // seconds
```

To enable multi-channel voting or apply filters, adapt the signal processing section before the `detect()` call.

---

## ❗ Limitations

- Single-channel processing may miss focal events
- Muscle/motion artifacts can create false positives
- Browser memory usage scales with file duration

---

## 📦 Embedding

To embed Seizure Seeker into another web project:

```html
